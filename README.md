# PokemonGoDataCollection
A friend and I are creating a data submission project for Pokemon Go and I decided to write a program in Python using Selenium to help me submit the data.

It stores my Trainer Name and Level, and asks only a few questions about the Pokemon to then submit IV data to either a Trade IV distribution Google Form or a Wild Catch IV Data ditribution Google Form. Selenium then fills in the data to the form and submits it online.
