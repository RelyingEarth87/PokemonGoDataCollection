# PokemonGoDataCollection
A friend and I are creating a data submission project for Pokemon Go and I decided to write a program in Python using Selenium to help me submit the data. If you would like to submit, read on.

It stores my Trainer Name and Level, and asks only a few questions about the Pokemon to then submit IV data to either a Trade IV distribution Google Form or a Wild Catch IV Data ditribution Google Form. Selenium then fills in the data to the form and submits it online.


TO SUBMIT DATA FOR THIS PROJECT:

If you would like to submit data, you will need to install Python and Selenium. Both are free. Once you install Python, you can just go to your command line and type in "pip install selenium". For me, for some reason, that didn't work. I had to type in "python -m pip -U selenium" you can try any combination with the python, pip, install, selenium and -m or -U until it actually installs. The -m and -U are in the order they need to be, but for some reason my command line did not recognize the command "install". I don't know why I had to try different things to get it to work. 

After, you should be able to download and use the file. 

You'll need to change the name variable to your trainer name and adjust your level. Then you will need to either download Chromedriver or look up the proper web driver for whatever browser you would like to use.

After you've done all this, you should be good to go! Submit anything you possibly can. You can even bank data and submit later, but try not to do later than the same day if possible. We accept all data on trades and Wild Catch IVs, just make sure you know whether they were weatherboosted if it's wild or what friend you traded with to get the Pokemon and how good of friends you are with that person.
